**Django Fortress** is a security-first, military-grade SaaS boilerplate designed for the AI era. It implements **OWASP Top 10 2026** mitigations natively while maintaining a modern, high-performance frontend stack.

---

## 🎯 Primary Objectives

1.  **Security by Design**: Native mitigations for authentication, data integrity, and session management.
2.  **AI-Ready Architecture**: A robust backend infrastructure designed to handle secure AI integrations without compromising sensitive data.
3.  **Zero Technical Debt**: Strict adherence to quality gates (Ruff, Pyright) and a clean `src/` modular layout.
4.  **Production Parity**: Seamless transition between development and production via modular configuration and Docker.

## 🎓 The Educational Differentiator: Why > How

Unlike generic boilerplates, Django Fortress is built to be a learning tool for architects and security-conscious developers.

-   **The "Why" Guides**: Every architectural decision is backed by an **ADR (Architecture Decision Record)** in `docs/adr/`, explaining the rationale, trade-offs, and security implications.
-   **OWASP Mapping**: The documentation includes direct mappings between code implementations and OWASP Top 10 threats.
-   **Transparent Architecture**: No "magic" packages. We prefer modular, standard Django patterns that are easy to audit and hard to break.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Backend** | Django 6.0 (Python 3.12+) |
| **Frontend** | HTMX + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI |
| **Identity** | django-allauth (Email-first, MFA Ready) |
| **Database** | SQLite (Dev) / PostgreSQL (Prod) |
| **Quality** | Ruff (Linter), Pyright (Static Typing) |
| **Security** | Bandit (SAST), Semgrep (OWASP Scans) |
| **Testing** | Pytest + Pytest-Django (Strict TDD Mode) |

## 🛠️ Getting Started

The project uses a `Makefile` to standardize the workflow across all environments.

### 1. Installation
```bash
make install
```

### 2. Database & Data
```bash
make migrate
# Seed admin (admin@example.com / admin123) and plans
.venv/bin/python src/manage.py seed_data
```

### 3. Run Development Server
```bash
make run
```

### 4. Quality Suite (Run before every commit)
```bash
make check_code
```

## 📂 Project Structure

We follow the **`src/` layout** to separate core source code from configuration and infrastructure.

## 🗺️ Roadmap Overview

1.  **Phase 1 (Foundations)**: Infrastructure, Quality Standards, and Base Hardening. [DONE]
2.  **Phase 2 (Identity)**: Brute-force protection, MFA, and Mandatory Verification. [IN PROGRESS]
3.  **Phase 3 (Infrastructure)**: IaC with Terraform and AWS Hardening.
4.  **Phase 4 (Scalability)**: Redis, Celery, and Load Testing.
5.  **Phase 5 (AI Secure Prompt)**: Sanitized LLM integrations.
6.  **Phase 6 (API Economy)**: Hardened DRF and OpenAPI 3.1.

---

## 🛡️ Security Enforcement

The project enforces high standards via the `make check_code` gate:
- **Zero Errors Policy**: Zero errors allowed in Ruff (Linting) and Pyright (Typing).
- **Security Scans**: Automated Bandit and Semgrep scans on every build.
- **Strict TDD**: Minimum 90% coverage target for identity and core flows.
